# Photometric redshifts code tutorial 
(J. Pasquet, E. Bertin, M. Treyer, S. Arnouts and D. Fouchez)


**Description**
```
This code permits to make the inference phase on 100 images. The code calculate the photometric redshifts and the probabilities in each redshift bins to derive the PDF associated.  
```

**Download weights of the network:**
```
The files that contained the weights of the pretrained model can be downloaded at this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19QjIaJcbe7btlUDTHUWxC64-aEQk4r9Q?usp=sharing
```

**Setting up dependencies yourself**
```
python
tensorflow (pip install tensorflow)
numpy (pip install numpy)
```

**Running the code**
```
Type python test.py
```
