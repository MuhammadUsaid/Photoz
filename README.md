# Photometric redshifts from images using a Convolutional Neural Network

This repository contains the [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) model as well as a subset of multispectral [SDSS](http://www.sdss.org/) images for testing.

Check out [J. Pasquet et al. 2018](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06607) for a detailed description of the model and its performance.

The `test.py` [Python](https://www.python.org/)  code runs the CNN in inference mode on 100 example images (stored in `data/data_example.npz`) using a set of pretrained weights. The code computes a [photometric redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometric_redshift) estimate and the associated [PDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) over 180 redshift bins for each of the provided galaxy images.  

**Running the code**
It is as simple as
```
python test.py
```
The code has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6. The CNN model is built on top of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) framework and should be compatible with TF versions â‰¥ 1.4.1. The [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) packages are also required for running the code

As the CNN weights exceed GitHub's regular 100MB filesize limit, you must first download the zipped `pretrained_model/` folder [from here](https://projets.lam.fr/dmsf/files/16149/view) or [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19QjIaJcbe7btlUDTHUWxC64-aEQk4r9Q) and unzip it in the `photoz` directory.
